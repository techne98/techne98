# Hi, I'm techne98 👋

I am a programmer from the UK primarily focused on Rust. 

I'm interested in developer tooling, compilers, and PL theory, and I enjoy writing about what I learn on my [blog](https://techne98.com/blog).

If you would like to work with me or just say hi, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:techne98@proton.me).
